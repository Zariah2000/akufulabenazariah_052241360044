    <p>Kumasi Technical University was established in 1954 as Kumasi Technical Institute (K. T. I. ) to offer craft courses.</p> 
    <p>In 1963, the Institute was converted  to a non-tertiary Polytechnic status under the Ghana Education Service to start offering,
    <br> in addition, technician diploma and sub- professional courses.</p>
    <p>The Polytechnic Law, 1992 (PNDC L.321) elevated the Polytechnic to a tertiary institution <br>to provide high calibre skilled manpower with reference to manufacturing, commerce, science and technology to act as a catalyst for technological development.</p> 
    <br>As a Polytechnic it was one of the famous, elegant and vibrant Polytechnics in Ghana.</p>
    <p>The Technical University Act 2016, (Act 922) converted  Kumasi Polytechnic to the present Kumasi Technical University with the  aim of providing  higher  education in engineering, applied arts,
    <br> technology based disciplines, technical and vocational training.</p>
    <p>It is a spectacularly beautiful institution, which is located at the heart of the Garden city of West Africa, the capital city of the Ashanti Region of Ghana (Kumasi). 
    <br>It has within the period of its existence become  an important centre for the training not only for Ghana but also for other African countries.</p>
